This is a tiny pomodoro timer for Mac. It works with the command line, and displays native notifications.

I wrote a step by step tutorial on how I made it here: **[lesscake.com/pomodoro-timer-mac](https://www.lesscake.com/pomodoro-timer-mac)**.

To test it, first run `./pomodoro.sh` to load the functions. Then type `pwork` to start the work timer or `pbreak` for the break timer.
